; These are valid Lisp expressions:
; 2         (+2 3)          (+2 3 4)        (/ (- 7 1) ( - 4 2))

; pg. 9 (26)
; As we will see, all Lisp code takes this form. A language like C has a
;   more complicated syntax: arithmetic expressions use infix notation; function
;   calls use a sort of prefix notation, with the arguments delimited by commas;
;   expressions are delimited by semicolons; and blocks of code are delimited by
;   curly brackets. In Lisp, we use a single notation to express all these ideas.


; In Lisp, + is a function, and an expression like (+ 2 3) is a function call.

; quote operator: It does nothing
;   Lisp provides the quote operator as a way of protecting
;   expressions from evaluation.
(print (quote (+ 3 5))); (+ 3 5)
; ‚úÖ Here ' is an abbreviation for quote operator and we can use it by
;   affixing any expression with a single quote
(print '(+ 3 5)); (+ 3 5) ; 


; Data Types - integers, strings, symbols, lists
;   Both integers and stirngs evaluates to themselves
;   Symbols are words, ordinarily they are converted to uppercase, regardless of how you type them.
(print 'Artichoke); ARTICHOKE
; Symbols do not (usually) evaluate to themselves, so if you want to refer to a
;   symbol, you should quote it, as above.


; Lists are represented as zero or more elements enclosed in parentheses.
; The elements can be of any type, including lists.
; ‚úÖ üî• You have to quote lists, or Lisp would take them for function calls:
(print  '(my 3 "Sons")); (MY 3 "Sons") 
(print '(the list (a b c) has 3 elements)); (THE LIST (A B C) HAS 3 ELEMENTS)
; Notice that one quote protects a whole expression, including expressions
;   within it.
; ‚ù§Ô∏è You can build lists by calling list. üî• Since list is a function, its arguments
;   are evaluated. Here we see a call to + within a call to list :
(print (list 'my (+ 2 1) "Sons")); (MY 3 "Sons")

; ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è
; Lisp programs are expressed as lists.
; - If a list is quoted, evaluation returns the list itself.
; - If a list is NOT quoted, the list is treated as code, and
;   evaluation returns its value:

; For e.g, Here the first argument is quoted, and so yields a list. The second argument
;   is not quoted, and is treated as a function call, yielding a number.
(print (list '( + 2 1) ( + 2 1))); ((+ 2 1) 3)

; In Common Lisp, there are two ways of representing the empty list. You
;   can represent it as a pair of parentheses with nothing between them, or you
;   can use the symbol nil . It doesn't matter which way you write the empty
;   list, but it will be displayed as nil :
(print ()); NIL
(print nil); NIL
; You don't have to quote nil (though it wouldn't hurt) because nil evaluates
;   to itself.
(print 'nil); NIL ;
